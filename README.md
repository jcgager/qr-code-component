## Overview

This is my solution to the QR Code Component challenge provided by Frontend Mentor.
This was a novice level challenge to create a card shaped item with a QR code accompanied by a heading and a short paragraph. The card is surrounded by a colored margin that changes size based on the screen size (mobile or desktop).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This is my first HTML/CSS project on my own. I am self-taught with the only real training coming from  freeCodeCamp's [Resposive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). I learned very quickly that all the tutorials I did didn't stick very well, so I was forced to take a different approach and re-learn the basics. With the help of the [HTML & CSS guidebook](https://htmlandcssguidebook.com/index.html) I worked through my rough spots and had a much better understanding of how to tackle this challenge.

I still have a long way to go, but I really enjoyed this project and look forward to the next one.

### Continued development

This project was a simple one to use Flexbox to keep elements centered with. I would like to work with flexbox more, to get a better feel for it. I also look forward to learning Grid. 

### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS guidebook](https://htmlandcssguidebook.com/index.html) - A great interactive guide to help learn some best practices with html and css.

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I feel like even professionals even have this one bookmarked..
